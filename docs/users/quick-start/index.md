# Getting Started with Call Management

Call Management APIs allow you to programmatically configure the flow and routing of calls in your account, including the setup of the following:

* Company's business hours
* Call Forwarding
* Call Monitoring Groups
* Call Queues
* Answering Rules
* IVR

The Quick Start guides below will guide you in using our Call Answering Rules API in less than five minutes. The Call Answering Rules API allows you to query all preset answering rules for a particular extension (user). You can then use the unique answering rule id returned by the API to get details of that answering rule, or to update the rule with new values.
